Authentication is important to hide information from those who don't need to see it. It also allows you to see who is accessing the site and tailor content to specific users.
The LoginRequiredMixin and @login_required decorators are an easy way to force users to be logged in to see certain content. They also allow you to redirect users to the login page instead of showing an error.
The next query is an easy way of saving the place am unauthorized user was. Once the user logs in, instead of being sent to where you define, the go to the page that they tried to access when unauthenticated. This allows for a more seamless user experience.
For my project, unauthenticated users are not allowed to access anything but the login page. As a dashboard, this service will contain sensitive information about a setup that people don't need to access. As such, trying to navigate to any page will redirect you to the login
to get authenticated. As for new users, due to the nature of the dashboard, users are not allowed to create their own accounts. This prevents people from simply making an account and seeing sensitive info. An admin has to make the user account and they are able to make them
a normal user or superuser. I later plan on deciding what pages non-superusers should be able to see and the creation of temp passwords for new users that need to be changed on first login.
