My idea is to create a service status dashboard for the servers I already host (Apache Webserver, ESXI, Minecraft, Pterodactyl).

Features:

Dashboard - Will allow me to view the status of all my servers at a glance and have the ability to add additional servers.

Log Aggregation - A more detailed view as the aggregator will collect logs from the servers and present them to you. There will be alerts for serious errors in the logs and it will allow for advanced log filtering and views.

Branching Strategy:
The initial branching strategy is to have a unique branch per feature before merging to main.

Wireframes:
-Login page: Since there is information about internal services, a login page is needed.
-Main Page: This page will show the status of your services and allow you to add more.

Initialized the django project.
I called the initial app "dashboard_view" for the main screen. I also plan on adding "login" later. The project is called service_dashboard because that is the overall goal of the project.

I am using a virtual environment called "django3". This virtual environment will hold django and any other libraries I find I need. If the 2 project libraries diverge, I will create seperate environments for both of them.
