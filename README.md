This project aims to create a service status dashboard for the servers I already host (Apache Webserver, ESXI, Minecraft, Pterodactyl). This will allow me to view their status and logs from a centralized locations

Currently, I have added a login screen, log view screen, and dashboard screen.
The login screen is currently static, as I have not learned how to properly manage users yet.
The log view screen currently just shows all the logs that are in the db.
The dashboard also shows all the services and their status (UP or DOWN)
